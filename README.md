# Natours Project
#### (CSS, SASS)

Natours Project is a fictional website that I created as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's SASS Course on Udemy. I have used advanced CSS techniques such as Flexbox, Grid, CSS animations and popups as well as new SASS features that I have learnt such as extends and mixins. The entire webpage and the images are entirely responsive and scale to the viewport width through media queries, breakpoints, density switching and art direction. These changes will optimise the best performance for all devices.
